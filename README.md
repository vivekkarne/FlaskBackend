# Flaschemy
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

A backend system designed using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Postgres, and Docker to provide RESTful services to an E-Commerce website.

### API Documentation  
   [List of supported functions!](docs/apidocs.txt)  

### Backend system setup on your local machine
   A vanilla implementation of the backend system running on your local host.  
   [Detailed Instructions!](docs/localsetup.md)  

### Testing REST endpoints on local machine  
   A guide to Walk you through the setup and test suite run, all hosted on your local machine.  
   [Detailed Instructions!](docs/localtesting.md)  

### Running the backend system on Docker  
   Docker helps us make the application highly portable, hence it is desirable of every application to have its own docker build which would ease testing and development.   
   To setup the system on docker [Click here](docs/dockersetup.md)  

### Testing the REST endpoints using Docker  
   Docker helps us see the end to end output with as little configuration as possible. Here we try to achieve that by providing you instructions on [running an end to end test](docs/dockertesting.md) using docker.
